- 👋 Hi, I’m Ignacio Tiraboschi, you can find me as `@ignatirabo` (almost) everywhere. I'm a Detection Infrastructure engineer at [Eclypsium, Inc](https://eclypsium.com/).
- 🎓 I have a PhD in Computer Science from ENS, Paris where I worked with Xavier Rival and Tamara Rezk.
- 👀 I’m interested in the static analysis of programs for security properties.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning off-topic stuff like 3D Graphics!
- 🕹️ I love videogames too! My goal is to become a solo-dev using [**Godot**](https://godotengine.org/) and other open-source tools.
